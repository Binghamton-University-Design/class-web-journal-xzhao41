# Class Web Journal

This repository is to be used as a starting point in your class web journal.

To begin, edit the html inside index.html. Edit the first two posts to reflect your first project in this class. One post for process, and one for your final piece.

Additionally, you may change color, font, typography, etc by editing the style.css file.
